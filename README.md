## Pomodoro Timer App

This project is a Pomodoro Timer application developed using React and TypeScript. Material UI was used for the design of the application.

### Features

- **Pomodoro Technique Implementation**: The application facilitates the utilization of the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.
  
- **Multiple Timers**: The app includes three timers:
  - **Work Timer**: The work cycle lasts for 25 minutes.
  - **Break Timer**: The break cycle lasts for 5 minutes.
  - **Long Break Timer**: The long break cycle lasts for 15 minutes.
  
- **Notification Alarm**: Each timer includes a notification alarm that alerts the user when the cycle finishes.

### About Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It utilizes a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility and productivity. It can be particularly helpful for individuals who struggle with distractions or procrastination. The technique is named after the Italian word for "tomato" ("pomodoro"), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
